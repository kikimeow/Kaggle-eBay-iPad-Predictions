# Which iPad listing will be sold on eBay?
This is a class project for MITx Analytics Edge 15.071x.  The project challenges students to develop an analytics model that will help buyers and sellers to predict the sales success of a set of eBay listings for Apple iPads from spring 2015.  The independent variables consist of 9 pieces of product data available at the time the iPad listing is posted, and a unique identifier. 

[Insights](https://github.com/kikimeow/Kaggle-eBay-iPad-Predictions/blob/master/Project%20Summary%20-%20eBay%20iPad%20Predictions.pdf) were gained regarding:
1. the major factors contributing to the success of a sale.
2. how a listing can be modified to ensure sales success.

To run the model, modify the path on Run.R.  Create a data folder in the path and save data into the data folder. 

Two model creation files are included.  One uses H2O ensemble, the other one is Random Forest tunned using the caret package. 
H2O Ensemble can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble)
