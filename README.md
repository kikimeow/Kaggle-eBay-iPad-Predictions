# Which iPad listing will be sold on eBay?
This is a class project for MITx Analytics Edge 15.071x.  The project challenges students to develop an analytics model that will help buyers and sellers to predict the sales success of a set of eBay listings for Apple iPads from spring 2015.
The competition is hosted on the Kaggle platform.
The independent variables consist of 9 pieces of product data available at the time the iPad listing is posted, and a unique identifier.
